What happens when you initialize a repository?  why do you need to do it?

     .git directory is made and files in repository directory will start getting tracked.

how is teh staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  what value does it offer?

temporary placehold for files that will be committed.  not all files have to go here so it's useful to review/visualize what will be committed before actually doing it.
