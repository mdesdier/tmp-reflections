When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when sharing with others or as a back up for local work


Describe differences between forks, clones, and branches.


Forks are for making copies of repositories on github for our own use.
Clone brings repository to local machine.
Branches are labels on specific commits to separate code paths (e.g. to try out a feature)

How would you collaborate wihtout using git or github?
would be more difficult through email/sending files.   


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

make changes in branch so you can do a pull request and make them reviewable by others.  if you just make changes on master and push, it wont be reviewed.
