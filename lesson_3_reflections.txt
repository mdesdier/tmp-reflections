When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when sharing with others or as a back up for local work


Describe differences between forks, clones, and branches.


Forks are for making copies of repositories on github for our own use.
Clone brings repository to local machine.
Branches are labels on specific commits to separate code paths (e.g. to try out a feature)

How would you collaborate wihtout using git or github?
would be more difficult through email/sending files.
